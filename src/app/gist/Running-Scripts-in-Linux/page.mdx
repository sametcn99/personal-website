# Running Scripts in Linux

Scripts in Linux need proper permissions and execution settings to run correctly. Here's how to run scripts in Linux:

- Navigate to the scripts directory.
- Add execute permissions to the script using: `chmod +x script_name.sh`.
- Run the script using: `./script_name.sh`.

## Additional Tips

1. Using `chmod`

   - `chmod +x` adds execution permission
   - `chmod 755` sets read, write, execute for owner and read, execute for others

2. Alternative Run Methods

   - Using bash directly: `bash script_name.sh`
   - Using sh: `sh script_name.sh`

3. Best Practices
   - Always verify script contents before executing
   - Use appropriate shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`)
   - Test scripts in a safe environment first
