# Docker Command Documentation

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers package an application’s code, libraries, and dependencies together in an isolated environment. The Docker CLI (command-line interface) provides a rich set of commands for managing images, containers, networks, and volumes. The sections below detail the basic Docker commands along with their syntax, description, and usage examples.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1. Checking Docker Installation

- **`docker version`**  
  Displays detailed version information for both the Docker client and daemon.

  ```bash
  docker version
  ```

- **`docker info`**  
  Provides system-wide information about Docker (such as number of images, containers, storage driver, and more).

  ```bash
  docker info
  ```

These commands are often the first step to verify that Docker is properly installed and running on your system.

---

## 2. Working with Docker Images

Docker images are the blueprints used to create containers.

### 2.1. Pulling an Image

- **`docker pull`**  
  Downloads an image from a Docker registry (default is Docker Hub).  
  **Syntax:**

  ```bash
  docker pull [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG]
  ```

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  docker pull ubuntu:latest
  ```

  This command downloads the latest Ubuntu image.

### 2.2. Building an Image

- **`docker build`**  
  Creates an image from a Dockerfile and context (the set of files at a specified location).
  **Syntax:**

  ```bash
  docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -
  ```

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
  ```

  Here, Docker reads the Dockerfile in the current directory (.) and tags the resulting image as `myapp:1.0`.

### 2.3. Listing and Removing Images

- **`docker images`**  
  Lists all images on your local system.

  ```bash
  docker images
  ```

- **`docker rmi`**  
  Removes one or more images from your local repository.
  **Syntax:**

  ```bash
  docker rmi [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE...]
  ```

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  docker rmi myapp:1.0
  ```

- **`docker tag`**  
  Creates a new tag for an image.
  **Syntax:**

  ```bash
  docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
  ```

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  docker tag myapp:1.0 myusername/myapp:latest
  ```

---

## 3. Managing Docker Containers

Containers are running instances of Docker images.

### 3.1. Running a Container

- **`docker run`**  
  Creates and starts a container from a specified image.
  **Syntax:**

  ```bash
  docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
  ```

  **Key Options:**

  - `-d`: Run container in detached (background) mode.
  - `-it`: Allocate a pseudo-TTY and keep STDIN open (interactive mode).
  - `--name`: Assign a custom name to the container.
  - `-p`: Publish a container’s port(s) to the host.

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name webserver nginx:latest
  ```

  This command runs the NGINX container in the background, maps port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the host, and names it “webserver”.

### 3.2. Listing Containers

- **`docker ps`**  
  Lists all currently running containers.

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- **`docker ps -a`**  
  Lists all containers (including stopped ones).

  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```

### 3.3. Stopping, Restarting, and Removing Containers

- **`docker stop`**  
  Gracefully stops a running container.
  **Syntax:**

  ```bash
  docker stop CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
  ```

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  docker stop webserver
  ```

- **`docker restart`**  
  Restarts one or more containers.

  ```bash
  docker restart webserver
  ```

- **`docker kill`**  
  Immediately kills a running container without a graceful shutdown.

  ```bash
  docker kill webserver
  ```

- **`docker rm`**  
  Removes one or more containers. (Use `-f` to force remove a running container.)

  ```bash
  docker rm webserver
  ```

### 3.4. Executing Commands Inside Containers

- **`docker exec`**  
  Runs a command inside a running container.
  **Syntax:**

  ```bash
  docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]
  ```

  **Example (interactive shell):**

  ```bash
  docker exec -it webserver bash
  ```

  This opens an interactive Bash shell inside the container named “webserver”.

### 3.5. Viewing Container Logs

- **`docker logs`**  
  Fetches and displays the logs from a container.
  **Syntax:**

  ```bash
  docker logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
  ```

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  docker logs webserver
  ```

  You can add the `-f` flag to follow log output in real time.

### 3.6. Inspecting Containers

- **`docker inspect`**  
  Returns low-level information about a container (or other Docker objects) in JSON format.

  ```bash
  docker inspect webserver
  ```

---

## 4. Managing Docker Volumes and Networks

Persistent data and networking are essential for containerized applications.

### 4.1. Docker Volumes

- **`docker volume create`**  
  Creates a new volume.

  ```bash
  docker volume create my-volume
  ```

- **`docker volume ls`**  
  Lists all volumes.

  ```bash
  docker volume ls
  ```

- **`docker volume rm`**  
  Removes a volume.

  ```bash
  docker volume rm my-volume
  ```

Volumes allow you to persist data independently from the container lifecycle.

### 4.2. Docker Networks

- **`docker network create`**  
  Creates a new network.

  ```bash
  docker network create my-network
  ```

- **`docker network ls`**  
  Lists all networks.

  ```bash
  docker network ls
  ```

- **`docker network rm`**  
  Removes a network.

  ```bash
  docker network rm my-network
  ```

Using custom networks helps containers communicate securely.

## 5. System Cleanup and Advanced Commands

### 5.1. Cleaning Up Unused Resources

Over time, unused images, containers, networks, and volumes can accumulate.

- **`docker system prune`**  
  Removes all stopped containers, dangling images, unused networks, and optionally, volumes.

  ```bash
  docker system prune -a --volumes
  ```

  This command helps free up disk space.

- **`docker image prune`**  
  Removes dangling images (images not tagged or referenced by any container).

### 5.2. Other Useful Commands

- **`docker tag`** – Retag an existing image.
- **`docker commit`** – Create a new image from changes made to a container’s filesystem.

  ```bash
  docker commit CONTAINER newimage:tag
  ```

- **`docker login` and `docker logout`** – Authenticate with and sign out from a Docker registry.

  ```bash
  docker login
  docker logout
  ```

These commands round out the basic functionality needed to work effectively with Docker.

By understanding and practicing these commands, you will have a strong foundation in Docker’s capabilities and be well on your way to containerizing your applications successfully.

Below is an updated section of the Docker command documentation that not only covers the basic commands but also provides detailed, step‐by‐step instructions on how to start a containerized application using Docker. This guide explains the process, the flags used, and best practices, so that you can easily run your containerized application and understand what is happening behind the scenes.

## 7. Starting a Containerized Application

When your application is containerized—that is, packaged into one or more Docker images—you use Docker to start (or “run”) containers based on those images. This section explains in detail how to launch a containerized application, along with explanations of the commonly used options.

### 7.1. The Basic `docker run` Command

The fundamental command to create and start a container is:

```bash
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

- **IMAGE**: This is the name (and optionally the tag) of the Docker image that contains your application.
- **COMMAND** (optional): You can override the default command defined in the Dockerfile by specifying your own command here.
- **ARG** (optional): Any arguments you wish to pass to the command.

### 7.2. Example: Running a Web Application

Imagine you have containerized a web application using an image named `myapp:latest`. To start this container so that the web service is accessible, you might use:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-webapp myapp:latest
```

Let’s break down what each flag means:

- **`-d` (Detached mode)**:  
  Runs the container in the background. This is ideal for long-running services (e.g., web servers) since you aren’t tying up your terminal.

- **`-p 8080:80` (Port mapping)**:  
  Maps port 80 of the container (the port on which the application listens) to port 8080 on your host.  
  This means when you open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`, you are accessing the application running inside the container.

- **`--name my-webapp` (Container name)**:  
  Assigns a custom name (“my-webapp”) to the container, making it easier to reference in subsequent commands (e.g., for stopping, inspecting, or removing the container).

- **`myapp:latest` (Image name and tag)**:  
  Specifies the Docker image that the container will be created from. The tag “latest” denotes that the most recent version of the image is used.

### 7.3. Starting a Container Interactively

Sometimes you may want to interact directly with the container’s shell for debugging or manual configuration. To do so, you use interactive mode along with a pseudo-TTY:

```bash
docker run -it --name debug-container myapp:latest bash
```

- **`-it`**:  
  Combines `-i` (interactive – keeps STDIN open) and `-t` (allocates a pseudo-TTY) to give you an interactive shell session inside the container.

- **`bash`**:  
  Overrides the default command and starts a Bash shell so that you can manually inspect or change configurations within the container.

### 7.4. Using Environment Variables

Many containerized applications require configuration via environment variables (for example, setting a database connection string or an API key). You can pass these variables using the `--env` (or `-e`) flag:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-webapp -e APP_ENV=production -e API_KEY=abcdef123456 myapp:latest
```

- **`-e APP_ENV=production`** and **`-e API_KEY=abcdef123456`**:  
  These flags set environment variables inside the container. The application can then read these variables at runtime to adjust its behavior accordingly.

### 7.5. Persisting Data with Volumes

If your application writes data that you don’t want to lose when the container stops or is removed, you can use volumes. For example, if your web application stores uploaded files, you might run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-webapp -v /host/path/uploads:/app/uploads myapp:latest
```

- **`-v /host/path/uploads:/app/uploads`**:  
  Maps the host directory `/host/path/uploads` to the container’s `/app/uploads` directory. Any files written by the container to `/app/uploads` will be stored on your host machine.

### 7.6. Networking Considerations

If your application is part of a larger system (e.g., a multi-container setup with a separate database), you might need to attach the container to a custom Docker network:

```bash
docker network create my-app-network
docker run -d --name my-webapp --network my-app-network -p 8080:80 myapp:latest
```

- **`docker network create my-app-network`**:  
  Creates a new user-defined bridge network.
- **`--network my-app-network`**:  
  Connects your container to this network so it can easily communicate with other containers attached to the same network (such as a database container).

### 7.7. Running Multi-Container Applications with Docker Compose

For applications that require multiple services (e.g., a web server, a database, a cache), Docker Compose is a powerful tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. A typical `docker-compose.yml` file might look like this:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    image: myapp:latest
    container_name: my-webapp
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=production
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/app/uploads
    networks:
      - app-network

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    container_name: my-database
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db-data:
```

To start the multi-container application defined in the file, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- **`docker-compose up -d`**:  
  This command reads the `docker-compose.yml` file, builds (if necessary) and starts all the defined services in detached mode.

Docker Compose simplifies the orchestration of multiple containers, ensuring that they are all configured correctly and can communicate with each other.

## 8. Recap and Best Practices

- **Verify Docker is Running**: Always check your installation with `docker version` and `docker info`.
- **Use Meaningful Names**: The `--name` flag helps in managing containers.
- **Map Ports Thoughtfully**: Ensure the host-to-container port mapping (with `-p`) does not conflict with other services.
- **Leverage Environment Variables**: Use `-e` to pass configuration parameters securely.
- **Persist Data with Volumes**: Use `-v` to keep data safe even if containers are recreated.
- **Use Networks for Multi-Container Apps**: Custom networks ensure secure and efficient inter-container communication.
- **Consider Docker Compose for Complex Setups**: It simplifies the management of multi-container applications.
