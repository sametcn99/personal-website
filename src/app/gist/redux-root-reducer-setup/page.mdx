# Redux Provider Component

```typescript
"use client";
import reduxStore from "@/lib/redux/store";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <Provider store={reduxStore}>{children}</Provider>;
}
```

## Redux Root Reducer

```typescript
// Import the combineReducers function from Redux Toolkit to combine multiple reducers into a single root reducer
import { combineReducers } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

// Import individual slice reducers
import counterReducer from "./slices/counterSlicer";
import searchReducer from "./slices/searchSlicer";
import todoReducer from "./slices/todoSlicer";
import userReducer from "./slices/userSlicer";

// Combine the individual reducers into a root reducer using combineReducers
// The keys in the resulting state object will correspond to the names given to the individual reducers
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterReducer, // Reducer for managing counter-related state
  user: userReducer, // Reducer for managing user-related state
  todo: todoReducer, // Reducer for managing todo's
  search: searchReducer, // Reducer for managing search state
});

// Export the combined root reducer as the default export of this module
export default rootReducer;
```
