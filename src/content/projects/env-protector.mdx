## ü§î Why this extension?

Most similar extensions hide environment files only after they are opened, which means sensitive information is briefly visible - even if for a short moment. This approach isn't ideal for streamers or anyone concerned about accidentally exposing sensitive data, especially since the toggle feature in other extensions isn't very user-friendly.

This extension takes a different approach: it asks you how you want to open the file before it's even opened, and operates according to your choice. This proactive protection ensures that sensitive information is never accidentally exposed during live streams or screen sharing.

## üöÄ Features

- **üîí Toggle Visibility of Environment Files**: Easily toggle the visibility of environment files in the sidebar. This command modifies your workspace settings by adding `"**/.env*": true` to the `files.exclude` section in your `settings.json`.  
  ![Commands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sametcn99/env-protector/refs/heads/main/assets/commands.png)
- **üõë Confirmation Prompt Before Opening**: Prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data by receiving a confirmation prompt before opening an `.env` file. This safeguard adds an extra layer of security when handling critical environment variables.

- **ü§ê Mask Sensitive Data**: Automatically mask sensitive environment variables when viewing `.env` files. Variable values are replaced with asterisks, allowing you to review the structure of the file without compromising the actual data.  
  ![Masked Variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sametcn99/env-protector/refs/heads/main/assets/masked.png)
- **‚ûï Add Environment Value Without Opening**: Insert new environment variables directly from the command palette without needing to open the `.env` file. This feature minimizes exposure risks while making it easy to update your environment.
