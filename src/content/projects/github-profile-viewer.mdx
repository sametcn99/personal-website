### Discover the Stories Hidden Inside GitHub Profiles

**GitHub Profile Viewer** isn’t just a tool—it’s a new way to _experience_ the open-source world.
What began as a bold **Next.js** and **Radix UI** experiment quickly grew into something bigger. When performance ceilings appeared, I didn’t settle for workarounds—I tore it down and rebuilt it with **Blazor** and **.NET**. The result is a faster, cleaner, more immersive platform that turns a simple profile lookup into a deep exploration of a developer’s impact.

#### What Makes It Special

This platform taps directly into the **GitHub REST API** to bring you live, detailed insights into any developer’s projects, networks, and contributions. Whether you're a curious coder, a recruiter searching for exceptional talent, or an open-source enthusiast, this tool peels back the curtain and shows what truly drives the world’s dev community.

#### ✨ Core Superpowers

- 🧭 **Immersive Profile Navigation** — Move beyond surface-level info and explore repositories, descriptions, language usage, and more with fluid ease.
- 🌐 **Network Mapping** — Visualize a developer’s professional graph and discover the people shaping their coding universe.
- ⭐ **Contribution Heat** — Track commitment and influence through detailed contribution stats and starred repositories.
- 📜 **Gist Explorer** — Peek into unique coding patterns and micro-projects through public Gists.
- 🪐 **Universal Reach** — Instantly analyze any public GitHub profile with no setup, no friction, just insight.
- 🧑‍💻 **Recruiter’s Shortcut** — Evaluate technical skills, influence, and community engagement—all in one place.

   - **Stack**: Blazor, .NET, GitHub REST API
   - **Vibe**: Rock-solid performance, real-time responsiveness, and C# elegance.
