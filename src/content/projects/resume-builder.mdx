# Resume Builder

This project is a desktop application that allows users to create and manage their resumes.  
It is developed with C# and Windows Forms, and uses a SQL Server database to store and retrieve data.

The application provides a user-friendly interface for entering personal details, job history, education, skills, and other relevant information.
